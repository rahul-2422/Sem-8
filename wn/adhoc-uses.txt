Collaborative Computing: Ad hoc networks facilitate collaborative computing environments where multiple devices, such as laptops or smartphones, can form a temporary network and share resources, data, or processing power to solve complex computational problems or perform distributed tasks.

Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs): These networks are formed by vehicles equipped with wireless communication devices, enabling them to exchange information about traffic conditions, road hazards, and other relevant data. VANETs can improve road safety, optimize traffic flow, and provide navigational assistance in intelligent transportation systems.

Emergency and Disaster Relief Operations: Ad hoc networks are particularly useful in emergency situations where the existing communication infrastructure may be damaged or unavailable. These networks can be quickly deployed to enable communication among emergency responders, rescue teams, and affected communities. They facilitate the coordination of rescue efforts, resource allocation, and information sharing during natural disasters, accidents, or other critical incidents.

Military and Battlefield Communications: Ad hoc networks are widely employed in military operations, especially in hostile environments or remote areas where traditional communication infrastructure is unavailable or unreliable. These networks allow soldiers, vehicles, and equipment to communicate and exchange data securely, enabling efficient coordination and situational awareness on the battlefield.
