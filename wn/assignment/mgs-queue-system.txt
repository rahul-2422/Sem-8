Toll Booths:

Arrivals of vehicles at toll booths follow a Poisson process (M).

Service times for processing vehicles can have a general distribution (G), such as a Weibull distribution, due to variations in payment methods and traffic flow.

Multiple toll booths or servers (S) are available to serve vehicles.
